# HaateKhori
This is a project that is intended to help the child and their parents in their education. There are mainly three types of features: learn to write, know your surroundings, and know you.  Learn to write by helping in writing Bangla and English characters and numbers. In knowing your surroundings, the child will learn and identify different shapes and objects. Know your feature is to help a child in learning and identifying relatives and body parts.
